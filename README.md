# SQL Scripts for Reducing Search Space in Biometric Databases Using the OMNI Technique

This repository contains SQL scripts that support the article titled "Reducing the Search Space in Biometric Databases using the OMNI Technique with Matching as a Distance Measure." The article proposes a method to optimize biometric database searches by applying the OMNI technique.

The OMNI technique is used to reduce the search space in large-scale biometric databases, improving the efficiency of identification processes. The SQL scripts in this repository demonstrate how to implement and test this method within a database environment.
